# TPMS_Lattice_Generator

**TPMS_Lattice_Generator** is an interactive desktop tool for generating Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) lattices and *hybrid/graded* TPMS structures.  
It is designed for additive manufacturing workflows and mechanical property studies where you want precise control over lattice type, grading direction, transition behavior, and target relative density (RD).

> **One sentence:** Generate TPMS lattices (P/G/D/I/N), blend two topologies with a controllable transition region, preview in 3D, then export STL for printing/simulation.

## ✨ Highlights

- **TPMS library**: Primitive (P), Gyroid (G), Diamond (D), I-WP (I), Neovius (N)
- **Hybrid / graded TPMS**: blend Topology A → Topology B with a logistic transition
- **Grading directions**:
  - Z-gradient (bottom → top)
  - X-gradient (left → right)
  - Diagonal X–Z gradient
- **Target relative density (RD) control**: generate lattices based on a user-defined RD (0–1)
- **Dual resolution workflow**:
  - fast **Preview Res**
  - high-quality **Export Res** for STL
- **GUI quality-of-life**:
  - **Dark / Light theme** switch
  - **中文 / English** UI switch
  - Screenshot button for quick documentation
  - Standard views (Top / Front / Right) + Reset
- **Binary STL export** with progress + cancel support
